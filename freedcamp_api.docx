Description
This wiki describes Freedcamp public API things. 

API end point: https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/.
Postman collection which contains ready-to-go requests.
Usage example (PHP).

Setup
To setup API for you please:



1 - go to My Account/Integrations/API

2 - generate a new API key

3 - to access this page

Authentification
You may generate API keys on the Integrations/API tab on My Account page. There are two types of keys: secured by API secret and not secured (you may change the type when you want). We highly recommend to use Secured keys for your needs when possible, but for quick testing, you may want to omit additional security.

Not secured API keys
Just pass the api_key with the key value as a GET or POST parameter, for example:

https:// freedcamp.com/api/v1/sessions/current?api_key=api_key
Not secured API keys have expiration time in one week. This can be changed later.

Note that anyone who has access to your active not secured API key can do most of the actions available via API. NEVER share unsecured API key with anyone. If you suspect a key leak, please convert the key to the secured with API secret or delete it. We'll forbid some types of actions (like project or account deletion) for not secured keys soon.

Zapier API keys
These keys are used for Zapier integration. These keys will only work for Zapier requests. Note that anyone who has access to your Zapier API key is also able to connect to your Freedcamp data with Zapier. These keys also have restricted permissions.

Secured API keys
To auth with these keys, except the key itself you need to also pass a timestamp and hash parameters. A timestamp is the request timestamp (check you have properly set time on your server), and a hash is calculated using API secret in this way (PHP code for example):

$hash = hash_hmac('sha1', $api_key . $timestamp, $api_secret);
So the request will look like:

https:// freedcamp.com/api/v1/sessions/current?api_key=api_key&timestamp=current_ts&hash=your_hash
Get your API secret on the API tab on My Account page (you will need to enter your password). NEVER share API secret with anyone and do not pass it publicly. Let us know if you suspect API secret key leak.
Please check the "Calculating hash for secured API key" chapter below for more details.

Passing API key in the header
To not pass the API key as an URL parameter or inside POST body you may pass it via X-API-KEY header. This approach is used in requests in Postman collection.

Other methods
We plan to implement Oauth2 auth later on.

Examples
Postman collection which contains ready-to-go requests. Check "Setting up Postman" section below for details.
Usage example (PHP).

Request
If a request should be done with any non-GET parameters (except auth parameters), it's supposed that they are passed as a form-data parameter with name 'data' and JSON-encoded value.

Example:

data: {"email": "test@email.com", "password": "11111111"}
You may pass your auth credentials as POST data as well as in the GET with payload:

api_key: api_key
timestamp: current_ts
hash: your_hash
data: {"email": "test@email.com", "password": "11111111"}
PUT requests
All "update" requests which are described as PUT below should use POST requests. "Update" requests differ from "add" requests by passing id of the modified item. Later we may support PUT requests for updates.

Response
Each response returns JSON-encoded JS object with the following fields:

name	description
http_code	duplicates HTTP code passed in headers.
msg	'OK' on successful request, an error description otherwise.
error_id	in the case when an error occurred and was logged by API, will contain corresponding error_id you can use to refer to in your support request to Freedcamp.
maintenance (can be absent)	in the case when there is active or upcoming Freedcamp maintenance scheduled (see Maintenance below).
data	specific for the request data, empty if an error happened or nothing to return. If there were some errors to show to a user, they will be placed under "errors" field. errors.general means some general error, errors._some_filed_name_ - means that error is for some posted field (like validation error).
Examples of unsuccessful requests responses:

{
  "http_code": 500,
  "msg": "Server error occurred.",
  "error_id": 1621951,
  "data": [errors: {"general": "Server error occurred, please try onу more time."}]
}

{
  "http_code": 401,
  "msg": "Wrong credentials",
  "error_id": 0,
  "data": []
}

{
  "http_code": 404,
  "msg": "Unknown method",
  "error_id": 0,
  "data": []
}
Maintenance
When API endpoint is in the maintenance mode or there is upcoming maintenance, API, in addition to standard fields (msg, data, etc.), returns maintenance field on each request, which has the next fields:

name	description
start_ts	a timestamp of maintenance start
duration	the planned duration of the maintenance in minutes. A client should use it to inform users about planned time for service recovery ( which can be calculated as [start_ts + duration * 60]). The actual duration can be less than this value (if we finished maintenance sooner). Duration value may increase during the maintenance but has a low probability.
msg	a string with additional info for users about maintenance reasons. It can be empty. If it is not empty, should be shown somehow to the users in the client message about maintenance
start_ts	a timestamp of maintenance start
duration	the planned duration of the maintenance in minutes. A client should use it to inform users about planned time for service recovery ( which can be calculated as [start_ts + duration * 60]). The actual duration can be less than this value )if we finished maintenance sooner). Duration value may increase during the maintenance but has a low probability.
Example:

  "maintenance": {
    "start_ts": 1479848400,
    "duration": 60,
    "msg": ""
  }
Usually, maintenance field is being sent 60 minutes before the maintenance.

If Freedcamp AOI endpoint is already in the maintenance mode, it returns HTTP 503 in headers (and still returns the maintenance field):

{
  "http_code": 503,
  "msg": "Maintenance is in progress",
  "error_id": 0,
  "maintenance": {
    "start_ts": 1479848400,
    "duration": 60,
    "msg": ""
  },
  "data": {}
}
No actions were executed if API endpoint returned 503.

A client should not send requests more often than one per minute while getting 503 in response.

It's possible that web-interface is in maintenance mode and API endpoint is not and vice versa.

Common filtration and ordering
For some endpoints fetching the application items (like /tasks, /times, /issues, etc.) except the way described in the chapters, there is a hack - a quick way to get several filters combination for your API request:

1. Open the application on freedcamp.com (web UI).
2. Apply all needed filters and order.
3. Copy url with applied filters:


4. Extract GET parameters and add them to your API request:


Supported methods
/sessions
Used to start a new session, get information about a current session or close a current session.
Sessions are identified by a session token. Each device has own token with TTL of 1 week after the last action done in this session.
If you have no active token when setting up the session, a new token will be created and returned, otherwise, the old one will be returned.

GET
Only /sessions/current will work.
Returns the same data as POST request returns except for a token.

POST
WARNING: Is not supported now

Returns session token and all info needed for the initial screen if valid email/password are passed. X-API-TOKEN should be empty. HTTP code 401 will be returned if a user can't be logged in using given credentials.

Input data: email, password, oauth_provider, oauth_access_token

name	description
email	should be always present except when signing in via Twitter which does not provide us with user's email
password	user password, can be empty when using OAuth token to sign in
oauth_provider	for signing in by OAuth provider,  should contain provider unique name. Allowed names are "facebook", "linkedin", "google", "twitter". It can be empty or absent if signing in by email+password.
oauth_access_token	
mobile_app_version	a version of the mobile app.
Output (inside 'data'):

name	description
projects	a list of all projects which user has access to.
users	a list of all users which current user can see in the projects he has access to. See structure example under /users request description.
groups	a list of all project groups which user has access to. Note that projects are ordered inside each group. To recreate projects order in projects dropdown in Web UI you should refer to groups list and projects list inside them. See structure example under /groups:GET request description.
notifications_count	unread notifications count
token	a session token to use further for API request inside headers
user_id	the user id of the session user

name	description
email	required
password 	can be empty in a case when oauth_provider parameter is passed
first_name	required
last_name 	can be empty
oauth_provider	if a user has done an unsuccessful login attempt using OAuth provider previously, an app may fill this field and oauth_access_token field with appropriate data to get user linked with the provider right after the registration. If OAuth provider has provided the app with email and first name, you can directly issue this request with an empty password (will be generated on the server side) without displaying a register screen to the user. Note that in case of returned errors (like empty email field) these errors will still correspond to register screen. A field can be empty or absent.
oauth_access_token	should be present if oauth_provider is set, can be empty or absent otherwise
mobile_app_version	a version of the mobile app
As to the avatar attached - please note, the maximum available square portion of the image will be used as an avatar (will be used the central part of the image), and it will be resized to 100*100 px.

X-API-TOKEN should be empty.

Example:

data: {"email": "bear+ss@deepshiftlabs.com", "password": "1111111111", "first_name": "fname", "last_name": "sdc"}

avatar: binary file data*

* i. e. request body contains 2 fields, string "data" and file "avatar", encoded as a form-data

Output: the same as /sessions:POST returns

PUT
(actual request should be /users/current:POST)

Input data: 

name	description
email	can be empty or absent. If present and differes from the current one, confirmation_password should be passed.
password 	SHOULD be empty or absent if user does not change it. If passed, confirmation_password should be passed also.
first_name	It can not be empty
last_name 	It can be empty
confirmation_password	Active password should be passed only when email or/and password are changed
timezone	User's timezone. To get a list of available timezones, use /timezones:GET
To update avatar, use /avatars/current:POST.

Request data example:

{
	"email": "some@freedcamp.com",
	"password": "",
	"first_name": "333",
	"last_name": "44444",
	"confirmation_password": "",
	"timezone": "America/New_York"
}
Output: the same as for /users/user_id:GET, also may contain token (see below).

WARN! If email and/or password is changed, a user will be logged out from all devices, including the current one (current token becomes invalid). So if a token is returned in the response, an application SHOULD replace the old token with this new one. Output example with a token is below. When different tokens for different sessions are implemented, a token will not become obsolete.

  "data": {
    "users": [
      {...}
    ],
    "token": "cc76fec61451717732153334d7e986acb380fcb2"
  }
DELETE
See /wipe for user deletion.

/wipe
/wipe/current

GET

Output (inside 'data'):

msg: Message you may show to the user, like "Reset key has been sent to xxx@xxx.com"

/passwords
Allows to set a new password using reset password key sent by issuing /password_reset_emails:POST request

POST
Input data:

password: new password.

name	description
reset_key	password reset key from the email
Example:

{"password": "11111111", "reset_key": "xxx"}
/avatars
POST
I plan to use only POST requests for all actions related to files uploading because of PUT limitations in PHP when working with files. That's why avatar update is not under the /users/current:PUT request.

Input data: 

form FILE field - binary avatar file (not inside the data parameter with JSON)

example:

avatar: binary file data*

* request body should be encoded as a form-data

Output:

avatar: an object which contains a new avatar URL. Example:

    "avatar": {
      "avatar_url": "https:\\/\\/freedcamp-avatars-test.s3.amazonaws.com\\/4b322be59235557135526b97d1e86de2.jpg"
    }
DELETE
Use /avatars/current to reset the avatar to a default generated an image.

Output: the same as for /avatars/current:POST.

/notifications
GET
/notifications - returns "notifications" array inside data for all projects.
WARN! - can be slow, please avoid to call it too often.

/notifications/project_id - returns "notifications" array inside data for given project id.

Filtration

By default, you get all notifications or all unread notifications in the project. To get unread notifications only for the items you are following (equal to "Things I follow" filter in web UI), pass a following=1 parameter:

/notifications?following=1 or /notifications/project_id?following=1.

Output:

notifications: Array of items with unread actions for the specified project. Read notifications are considered to be added later. Example:

    "notifications": [
          {
            "project_id": "344",
            "item_u_key": "267220_415075_2_488",

              }
            ]
name	description
project_id	project id of notification
item_u_key	id for item notifications, use it for "mark as read" request
f_read 	is always true as now we return only unread notifications
last_action_ts	used for setting item as read to determine if a user has seen the actual version
actions 	an array of actions, more recent actions first. "description_raw" may contain HTML tags, they are stripped in "description" field.
action_type	see types list in the Constants wiki
PUT
(actual request should be /notifications:POST)

Input data: 

name	description
new_state 	new state of notifications, possible values - read
items 	an array of items to apply the state to.
Structure of items array:
item_u_key 
last_action_ts

Request data example:

		"last_action_ts": "425235345"
	}]
}
/validations
GET
/notifications/email - checks if email used for an invitation is valid and does not exist in the project, also returns avatar URL if check passed. Probably these actions will be split/moved to different API URLs after discussions.

"email" in URL means a type of validation. 

Input:

name	description
email	email to validate
project_id	optional. If set, an output will contain an error if the email is already present in the project users
Request example: 

    data:   {"email": "", "project_id": "423242"}
Output:

avatar_url - on success

Example:

    "avatar_url": "https://freedcamp-avatars-test.s3.amazonaws.com/534d29407bfce199827779dbb4b4a3c8e_6eabef.png"
/tasks
GET
/tasks - returns a list of all tasks user has access to

/tasks/?project_id=xxx - list of tasks in the project

/tasks/task_id - list of tasks which contains only the task with given task_id

Custom fields

To include custom fields data in the response you need to add "f_cf=1" parameter, example: /tasks/?project_id=xxx&f_cf=1. Only fetch is supported for custom fields (no insert/update/delete). When you pass f_cf=1, the response will contain an additional array of custom fields templates used in the resulting task list.

Tags

You may pass "f_include_tags=1" GET parameter, then the response will contain 'tags' array with tag ids assigned to the item.

Limits

All /tasks:GET requests support limit and offset parameters. Example: "/tasks?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200.

All responses contain "meta" field:

    "meta": {
        "has_more": true, // always presents
        "total_count": 1362 // presents if has_more = true
    }
name	description
has_more	is true if there are more results after the last returned result in the response, and false otherwise.
total_count	presents if show_more = true and contains all available results count.
WARN: currently limit, offset, total_count values are applied to the top-level tasks. All subtasks are ignored when a limit is applied, and total_count is calculated.

Example

To fetch all the tasks, you need to execute set of requests like

https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=0
https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=200
https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=400
....

while there are results or meta.has_more is true.
Each request may return more than 200 tasks, if there are subtasks. All subtasks of the task are always returned in the one request (are not split between pages).

Filtration and order

/tasks and /tasks/?project_id=xxx requests support filtration and ordering. Filters/order can be applied in any combination.

Supported filters:

name	description
status	check constants wiki for possible values. For example, to get only not started and started tasks, you should use:  "/tasks?status[]=0&status[]=2"
assigned_to_id	accepts integer values containing user id or one of Assignments constants from constants wiki
created_by_id	accepts integer values containing user id
due_date[from]	accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the due date set and due date >= due_date[from] will be returned
due_date[to]	accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the due date set and due date <= due_date[to] will be returned
created_date[from]	accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the creation date >= created_date[from] will be returned
created_date[to]	accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the creation date <= created_date[to] will be returned
f_with_archived	
accepts 1/0 values. If 1 is passed, tasks from archived projects will be included to the response. If omitted or 0 is passed, only tasks from active projects are fetched.

lists_status	
Determines the status (i.e. active or archived) of Task Lists to fetch tasks from.  Accepts "active", "archived", "all" values. Omitting is equal to "active".
(Note: "Task list" is the new name for "Task Group". The old name is still used in API and this wiki).

Supported orders: 

priority: tasks with no priority set are supposed to have the lowest priority.
due_date: tasks with no due date set are always placed at the list end despite the order direction.

WARN: if there are many orders in the request, only the first one will be applied.
WARN: ordering is applied to Tasks groups for all orders except due_date. So if you have two tasks groups in output, there will be all tasks from the first group, and then all tasks from the second group in the output. For due_date order, Tasks groups order is ignored.
WARN: when ordering, subtasks are always following their parent tasks if these tasks are present in the output.

If not valid filter or order value is passed, this value is ignored.

Example: /tasks?status[]=0&due_date[from]=2017-02-01&due_date[to]=2017-02-28&created_date[from]=2017-01-01&&assigned_to_id[]=13&assigned_to_id[]=-1&assigned_to_id[]=0&created_by_id[]=15&order[due_date]=asc&lists_status=active

Output example for /tasks:GET:

Output:

tasks: list of tasks with the next fields:

name	description
id	task id
assigned_to_id	user id task is assigned to. May have values -1 (ASSIGNED_EVERYONE) and 0 (ASSIGNED_NOONE).
created_by_id	user id who created the task
task_group_id	
project_id	
priority	possible values: 0 (none), 1 (low), 2 (medium), 3 (high).
title	
description	raw description, with Freedcamp tags like [fcattach]. WARN - you should show this data to the user when editing.
description_processed	(absent if it's not a get one task by id) processed description, where [fcattach] tags are replaced with actual images with link. WARN - is present only when you request only one task, absent otherwise. You should show to user this data when showing task (and use raw "description" when editing).
status	one of the next values: 0 (not started), 1 (completed), 2 (in progress)
comments_count	
files_count	files attached to the task (files attached to task comments are not counted)
completed_ts	if was completed, ts when it happened, null otherwise
start_ts	null if it was not set
due_ts	null if it was not set
created_ts	
task_group_name	
f_archived_list	false if the task is in an active task list, true if the task is in an archived task list
priority_title	a title of the corresponding value in 'priority' field
status_title	title of the corresponding value in 'status' field
assigned_to_fullname	name of a user task is assigned to (will be discussed if we need it and in what format)
can_delete	(absent if a query is for more than one project)
can_edit 	(absent if a query is for more than one project)
can_assign 	(absent if a query is for more than one project)
can_progress 	(absent if a query is for more than one project)
can_comment 	(absent if a query is for more than one project)
comments 	(absent if it's not a get task by id) list of comments. Comments structure is described below
files	(absent if it's not a get task by id) list of files attached to the task. See /files:GET for structure description
url	URL for the task
cf_tpl_id	custom fields template id (if linked with the task)
custom_fields	(absent if custom fields are not requested) an array of custom fields values used for the task
h_level	shows the task nesting level, 0 for top-level tasks.
h_parent_id	shows the parent task id. Is an empty string for top-level tasks.
h_top_id	shows the top parent task id (so is equal to h_parent_id for subtasks with h_level=1, and differs for subtasks with h_level > 1). Is an empty string for top-level tasks.
r_rule	empty if the task is not recurring
order	set by user order inside tasks group (using d&d). By default tasks in output are ordered by this field inside their tasks groups.
WARN! It's possible that several tasks inside the same group have the same order value including default value (0).

WARN! It's possible that subtask has order equal to or greater than its parent(s). In this case, API ignores the order of subtask and places subtask after parent task (if a parent is present in output).

WARN! This field is NOT equal to the task position in the returned list.

f_adv_subtask	(absent if it's not a get one task by id) shows if this is an advanced subtask or not. True for advanced subtasks, false for usual tasks and not advanced subtasks. Advanced subtasks have the same properties (all editable) that usual tasks. Not advanced subtasks have title and status only, and status can be set only in "TODO_NOT_STARTED" or "TODO_COMPLETED" (no "TODO_IN_PROGRESS" status).  Not advanced subtasks can't have comments as well. It's possible for a user to have access to both advanced and not advanced subtasks at the same time even inside the same project.
Example:

    "tasks": [
      {
        "id": "1528",
        "h_parent_id": "1525",
        "h_top_id": "1524",

            }
        ]
      },
      ....
    ]
Comments structure: the same as /comments:POST returns.

If custom fields data is requested and there were custom fields templates linked to some tasks in the list, list of these templates will be returned in a separate array "cf_templates".
Here is an example of its structure:

"cf_templates": [
    {
        "id": "17",
        "title": "all fields",

                "dd_options": [
                    "the first option",
                    "the second option",
                ]
            },
            {
                "id": "1",

                "dd_options": null
            }
        ]
    }
]
dd_options array contains values for the dropdown type of custom field. For other field types, this field is set to null. Inside "custom_fields" array with values for the task, value for the field with dropdown type is the number of the value in the dd_options array (starting from 0). Also for dropdowns, there is an additional field dd_actual_value which contains the actual value (so you may know it without extracting it from dd_options by id).

POST
Input data: 

name	description
title	
description 	can be an empty string
project_id	
task_group_id	can be empty or absent (task will be added to the first task list).
priority 	priority id. See priorities for :get.
assigned_to_id	should contain assigned to user id OR one of the two constants:  -1 (ASSIGNED_EVERYONE) and 0 (ASSIGNED_NOONE)
start_date 	can be empty or absent, the format is YYYY-MM-DD (empty value will be used if start_date is not allowed for the plan. Old start_date will be overridden in this case, if any).
r_rule	the recurrence rule in iCalendar (RFC 5545) format, can be an empty string or absent
due_date 	can be empty or absent, the format is YYYY-MM-DD
attached_ids 	an array of files uploaded previously with temporary=1 flag
h_parent_id 	can be absent or empty. It contains a parent task id. Note: parent task should be in the same tasks group as passed task_group_id. WARN! if a project, where subtask is added to, does not allow advanced subtasks (i.e. has f_subtasks_adv = false, see above), added subtask should contain empty string for description and due_date fields, and "0" for priority and assigned_to_id fields. Also, the parent task should not be a subtask. In case when other values are passed, they will be implicitly fixed to the right values with triggering an error sent to Freedcamp developers. h_ stands for Hierarchy.
Request example:

{"title": "22222", "description": "wwwwwww", "project_id": "305", "task_group_id": "272", "priority": "1", "assigned_to_id": "1", "due_date": "2015-08-28", "r_rule": "RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5", "attached_ids": [1296, 1297]}
Output: the same as /tasks/task_id:GET

PUT
(actual request should be /tasks/task_id:POST)

WARN! If an edited task is a subtask (h_parent_id is not empty) and has f_adv_subtask = false, edited data should contain empty string for description and due_date fields, and "0" for priority and assigned_to_id fields, or these fields should be absent. Also, the parent task should not be a subtask. No limits if f_adv_subtask = true.

Input data: 

The same set as for /tasks:POST. You may pass only changed parameters as well and skip passing not changed.

h_parent_id - can be absent or empty. If it is absent, the current parent id value is not changed during the query. If it is not empty and the edited task is not a subtask, it becomes a subtask. If is empty and edited task is a subtask, it becomes a task. All children tasks of the edited task are still its children in any case. Note: parent task should be in the same tasks group as passed task_group_id. 

Request data example:

{"title": "QQrgfbQQfdvQ!!!!", "description": "dvsdvdsfvdfv", "task_group_id": "276", "priority": "2", "assigned_to_id": "123", "due_date": "2015-08-13", "status": "2", "attached_ids": [1296, 1297]}
Output: the same as /tasks/task_id:GET

/tasks:POST(PUT) with custom fields manipulation
With usual data passed when adding a task, you may pass additional fields:

"cf_tpl_id": 1, "custom_fields": [{"cf_id": "1", "value": "1"}, {"cf_id": "2", "value": "some text"}]
Custom fields data structure is described in /tasks:GET section above.

Warn - do not pass 'cf_tpl_id' and 'custom_fields' if you do not intend to actually change anything in custom fields. Only passed custom fields values will be updated.

Request data example to unlink custom field template from a task:

/tasks/task_id:PUT

{"cf_tpl_id": null}
DELETE
/tasks/task_id:DELETE

/milestones
GET
/milestones- returns a list of all milestones user has access to

/milestones?project_id=xxx - list of milestones in the project

/milestones/milestone_id - list of milestones which contains only the milestone with given milestone_id 

Limits

All /milestones:GET requests support limit and offset parameters. Example: "/milestones?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200.

All responses contain "meta" field:

    "meta": {
        "has_more": true, // always presents
        "total_count": 1362 // presents if has_more = true
    }
name	description
has_more	is true if there are more results after the last returned result in the response, and false otherwise.
total_count	presents if show_more = true and contains all available results count.
Example

To fetch all the milestones, you need to execute a set of requests like

https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=0
https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=200
https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=400
....

while there are results or meta.has_more is true.

Filtration and order

If you need more filters and orders please contact support.

Output example for /milestones:GET:

Output:

milestones: list of milestones with the next fields:

name	description
id	milestone id
project_id	
title	
description	raw description, with Freedcamp tags like [fcattach]. WARN - you should show this data to the user when editing.
description_processed	(absent if it's not a get one milestone by id) processed description, where [fcattach] tags are replaced with actual images with link. WARN - is present only when you request only one milestone, absent otherwise. You should show to user this data when showing milestone (and use raw "description" when editing).
assigned_to_id	user id milestone is assigned to. May have values -1 (ASSIGNED_EVERYONE) and 0 (ASSIGNED_NOONE).

(actual request should be /times/time_id:POST)

API supports property editing or actions. If there is a non-empty action field in POST, we handle action command execution, else - process property changes.

Input data (property editing): 

The same set as for /times:POST, except f_started, f_billed and project_id. You may pass only changed parameters as well and skip passing not changed.

Request data example:

{"description": "Edited time record", "assigned_to_id": "-1", "date": "2019-04-20", "minutes_count": "0"}
Output: the same as /times/time_id:GET

Input data (actions): 

Possible actions

name	description
start	starts time tracking for a time record. UI action: 'Start working'
stop	stops time tracking for a time record. Value from a timer is adding to a time record time value. UI action: 'Stop working'
bill	makes a time record billed, billed time record cannot be started and stopped. UI action: 'Mark as Completed'
unbill	returns a time record to progress, start and stop become available. User interface action is 'Back in Progress'
Request data example:

{"action": "stop"}
Output: the same as /times/time_id:GET

DELETE

/times/time_id:DELETE

/calendar_items

/backups
GET
/backups returns all existing backups.

Limits

/backups:GET request supports limit and offset parameters. Example: "/backups?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200. Backups are ordered by date created DESC, so the most recent backups are on top. It's recommended to use reasonable limit to get only last backups, like limit=20.

All responses contain "meta" field:

    "meta": {
        "has_more": true, // always presents
        "total_count": 120 // presents if has_more = true
    }
has_more is true if there are more results than were returned in the response, and false otherwise.
total_count presents if show_more = true and contains all available results count.

Output

name	description
id	
date_human	
url	Authorized S3 URL, expires in 24 hours
Example:

"backups": [
    {
        "id": "23422",

Calculating hash for a secured API key
Validation tool
Simple&rude html page where you can check if your hash is properly calculated (opens in a new tab).

Javascript
var secret = 'your secret API key';
var public_key = 'your secured public api key';
var ts = new Date().valueOf();
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(public_key + ts, secret);
var hash_string = hash.toString(); // send this to API
C#
The code below is kindly provided by Freedcamp user H. Gokhan Mamaci:

private static readonly Encoding encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
void Main()
{
   var key_public = "your secured public api key";
   var key_private = "your secret API key";
   var ts = UnixTimeStampTotalSeconds();
   var keyByte = encoding.GetBytes(key_private);

   using (var hmacsha1 = new HMACSHA1(keyByte))
   {
         hmacsha1.ComputeHash(encoding.GetBytes(string.Concat(key_public, ts)));
         var hashstr = ByteToString(hmacsha1.Hash);
         $"https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/sessions/current?api_key={key_public}&timestamp={ts}&hash={hashstr}".Dump();
   }
}

static string ByteToString(byte[] buff)
{
   string sbinary = "";
   for (int i = 0; i < buff.Length; i++)
       sbinary += buff[i].ToString("x2");
   return sbinary;
}

static string UnixTimeStampTotalSeconds()
{
   DateTime nx = new DateTime(1970, 1, 1); // UNIX epoch date
   TimeSpan ts = DateTime.UtcNow - nx;
   return ((long)ts.TotalSeconds).ToString();
}
Setting up Postman
Postman will allow you to easily check and test all the available methods. Note that not all methods in the collection are currently allowed for access through public API (like /wipe).
To get requests working for the example collection, you need to define 'xapikey' variable in the current Postman environment with the value of your api_key. No need to define cookie and xapitoken variables so far.
For a simple start you may use not-secured api_key - it does not require calculating hash.

If you want to use API key secured with API secret, you should define a pre-request script which will calculate hash based on the current time. You should end up having set up like shown below.

Url

{{apihost}}/api/v1/tasks?api_key={{public_api_key}}&timestamp={{timestamp}}&hash={{hash}}&limit=5&offset=0
Pre-request script

var public_api_key = "your api key";
var secret_key = "your api secret";
var timestamp = Math.floor(new Date().valueOf()/1000);

var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(public_api_key + timestamp, secret_key);

// lines below will be a bit different for the standalone version - you'll use pm.environment.set("public_api_key", public_api_key);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("public_api_key", public_api_key);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("timestamp", timestamp);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("hash", hash.toString());
Examples
Attaching files to tasks
There are two possible ways to attach a file to a task: 

1) Create a task. Now upload a file with "temporary=0" field and with proper values for project_id, app_id ('2' for Tasks) and item_id (i.e. task id).

curl -X POST \
  http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/files?api_key=your_api_key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \
  -F 'data={"project_id": "632", "application_id": "2", "item_id": "323", "comment_id": "", "temporary":0}' \
  -F 'file=@C:\file.txt'
2) Upload file(s) with "temporary=1" field and remember their id (returned in the response). You also need to set application_id and project_id.

curl -X POST \
  http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/files?api_key=your_api_key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \
  -F 'data={"project_id": "632", "application_id": "2", "item_id": "", "comment_id": "", "temporary":1}' \
  -F 'file=@C:\file.txt'
Returned file id = 1748. Now post a task, passing these id(s) in attached_ids field:

curl -X POST \
  http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/tasks?api_key=your_api_key \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \
  -F 'data={"title": "33333", "description": "wwwwwww", "project_id": "632", "task_group_id": "2599259", "task_group_name": "","task_group_description": "", "priority": "1", "assigned_to_id": "167", "due_date": "2015-08-28", "attached_ids":[1748]}'
